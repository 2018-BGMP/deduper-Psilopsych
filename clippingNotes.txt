Soft Clipping - Only occurs at the ends of reads. Doesn't count as Mis/match. Could clip at either ends of 

Trim from 3' end

Look for I & D in CIGAR string 

PCR duplicates have the same UMI
without UMI, for it to be a PCR duplicate, you must have same starting position. 

Chr1: 0 100M
Chr1: 5 5S95M

Must subtract soft-clipping value from chromosome starting position

Bitwise Flag
Look at strand specific - SEQ is being reverse complemented

Strand specific libraries

Randomers may be different, sequence super long randomers. 

Always adjust 5' start-site position 

We only care about soft Clipping on start sit

If bitwise flag is flagged, must adjust for start position
If not, you can use POS
